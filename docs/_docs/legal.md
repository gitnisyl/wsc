### Terms of Service

#### Definitions

When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to Wysc Staff, the administrative organization overseeing the properties.

When we say “Services”, we mean any product, service, and/or experience created and maintained by Wysc Staff. That includes Wysc Discord, Wysc GitHub, the Wysc website, and any official Wysc branded materials, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.

When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that interact with one or more of our Services.

#### Liabilities

We may update these Terms of Service in the future. You can track all recent changes [on GitHub](https://github.com/studywysc/wysc/commits/master/docs/_docs/legal.md){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That's true for any of our existing and future products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.

Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. [All Wysc Discord services are wholly supported by Discord.](https://discord.com/terms){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

***By participating in any of Wysc's processes, you expressly understand and agree that Wysc shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if Wysc has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use Wysc operated spaces; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from Wysc operated spaces; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party in Wysc operated spaces; (v) or any other matter relating to this Terms of Service or Wysc, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.***

If you have a question about any of the Terms of Service, please [contact us](/docs/contact).


<div id="privacy"></div>

### Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all Services as defined in the Terms of Service. Collectively, including high ranking Wysc members with moderation permissions, the organization will be referred to as "Wysc".


#### What we collect and why

Your identity in Wysc Discord is only connected to your public Discord user. We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties. Sometimes, we change your Wysc experience based on your public Discord user, such as when we add roles to users for being active.

You may provide personal information voluntarily, such as if you include information about yourself in `#introductions`. We will not treat them differently from any other public message you send. We don't extract personal information from your messages.

We log [information about your public Discord user](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-member-object){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for moderation, statistics, and service purposes. This includes but is not limited to: remembering your public Discord user and the roles you have during your time in Wysc Discord; logging the number of messages you send for EXP; and recording account creation timestamps. These logs are required to provide you services and keep Wysc safe, and will be kept as long as Wysc is alive.

We log edited and deleted messages in Wysc Discord for moderation purposes. These logs are deleted after 5 days on a rolling basis with an automated process. Some channels, such as `#bots-spam` and `#dailygoals`, are excluded from logs to help protect user privacy. A portion of Wysc contributors [in Contributor Hub](/docs/dev) have access to these logs.

**Wysc Website uses Google Analytics. Learn more at ["How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services"](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.** The website also uses certain cookies to store site preferences locally on your device (no data is sent to us), such as the theme you choose for Wysc Docs.

At this time, our sites and applications do not respond to Do Not Track beacons sent by browser plugins.

When you reach out to Wysc, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, solely for archive purposes. We neither collect nor process associated personal information beyond its role as a communication method.


#### When we access or share your information

Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we’ll ever access or share your info are:

- **To provide services:**  
We do use some third-party services to provide services and process some or all of your public Discord user information via these third parties. You can view the list of third-party services we use [on our Credits page](/docs/credits).
- **To moderate:**  
Any user can see [your public Discord user info](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [public Wysc Discord history](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000468588-Using-Search){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at any time, for any reason. Wysc usually does it for moderation purposes, but we may also use some processors for other administrative functions, which you can view at: [Credits - Wysc Admin](/docs/credits#wysc-admin).
- **To look at statistics:**  
We sometimes use your public Discord user information to make personalized statistics for you to look at. We also use aggregate statistics like channel activity to tweak the Wysc experience. These stats may be public.
- **When required by law:**  
Wysc is based in the US and all data infrastructure are located in the US. We will share data when required under applicable law.
- **When we move:**  
If Wysc is acquired by or merged with a company — we don’t plan on that, but if it happens — we’ll notify you before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.


<div id="rights"></div>

#### Your rights with respect to your information

At Wysc, we apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in the US. Wysc recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:

- **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
- **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
- **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
- **Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”.** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers.
- **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to <https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en>{: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
- **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)
- **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
- **Right to Portability.** You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
- **Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
- **Right to Non-Discrimination.** This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.


**Wysc collects public user information using a bot ("{{ page.wyscbot }}"). Learn more at ["Red and End User Data"](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/red_core_data_statement.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.**

#### How we handle your data

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} when transmitted from our servers to your browser.
{:.mb-2}
- Wysc Discord data is stored and delivered subject to [Discord's security practices](https://discordapp.com/privacy){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

**Wysc does not collect personal information.** We don't know you outside of your public Discord user or the public platform-specific method of identification of a processor.

**To delete your data**, see ["Your rights with respect to your information"](#rights). If you delete your Discord account, your messages may still remain in Wysc in anonymized form. We can't delete all of these for you, but if you [contact us](/docs/contact), we may be able to remove a limited number of individual messages from deleted users on request.

Our services and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States. By using our Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.

#### Changes

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. You can view a history of recent changes to our policies [on GitHub](https://github.com/studywysc/wysc/commits/master/docs/_docs/legal.md){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
