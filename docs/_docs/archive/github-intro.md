### Introduction
- The official Wysc repository lives at [https://github.com/coffeebank/wysc](https://github.com/coffeebank/wysc)
- Wysc uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is built into GitHub *(or more specifically, GitHub Pages)*
- All changes should be made to the `dev` Branch
    - ![GitHub screenshot - Branch listed is "dev"](/docs/assets/2020-03-19 051009.jpg)
- The Wysc Docs files live at [https://github.com/studywysc/wysc/tree/dev/docs/_docs](https://github.com/studywysc/wysc/tree/dev/docs/_docs)
    - There are three folders for each section of the Wysc Docs:
        - `about` - About Wysc
        - `discord` - Wysc Discord
        - `dev` - Contributor Hub
    - All assets (files, images, videos, etc.) should be stored under the `assets` folder
    - All documentation pages are in markdown (.md) file format
- To test how the website looks, a dev/staging website is available at [https://wyscdev.netlify.app](https://wyscdev.netlify.app).


### Front Matter

At the top of each page, there is content that lets Jekyll know how the page should be processed.

#### kbbots

When you use kbbots, the layout automatically formats anything you type into the Front Matter into the following:

```
botslist:
    - bottitle: Basics
      botcats:
        - Command
        - Description
        - Bot
      botcomms:
        - botcomm: ",rank"
          botdesc: See your Wysc activity level
          botname: Tatsumaki

        - botcomm:
            - ",ti"
            - ",ti --set"
            - ",ti @user"
          botdesc:
            - See your timezone (must set your time first)
            - Set your timezone
            - See another user's timezone
          botname: Parad√∏x
```
![A table with a search bar, with all commands formatted fancily](/docs/assets/2020-03-22 214227.jpg)

- **bottitle** - Heading 3 that should summarize the table of commands
- **botcats** - The headings for the table of commands
- Each **botcomms** is separated by a hyphen to indicate a separate row in the table of commands
- Commands should always be inputted between quotation marks
- **botdesc** should also be inputted between quotation marks if you have any of the following: commas, apostrophes, or any other special character

The accepted variables under **botcomms** is: botcomm (commands), botdesc (description), botperms (permissions), botname (name of bot), and botexam (example commands). 



### Page Content

- All documentation headings should use Heading 3 (`### Heading 3`) or Heading 4 (`#### Heading 4`)
- Upload all assets (files, images, videos, etc.) to [https://github.com/studywysc/wysc/tree/dev/docs/_docs/assets](https://github.com/studywysc/wysc/tree/dev/docs/_docs/assets)
    - In markdown, link to them as follows, replacing "Summary of the image here" and "yourfilename.jpg" as necessary:  
```
![Summary of the image here](/docs/assets/yourfilename.jpg)
```
